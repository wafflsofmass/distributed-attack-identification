# Distributed Attack Identification 

Commonly employed using "botnets".

Bot nets - a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge.
Recently identified is Aisuru, used to attack Azure.
Aisuru is a Turbo Mirai-class IoT botnet that frequently causes record-breaking DDoS attacks by exploiting compromised home routers and cameras, mainly in residential ISPs in the United States and other countries.

## Common Features
- Hacking/hijacking IoT devices (So all would be under same IP)
- Typically UDP, but can be TCP or GRE (More on Aisuru and related)
- Pseudo-randomized, purposeful, and arbitrary TCP flag combinations have all been observed, with as many as 119 distinct TCP flag combinations observed in a single attack. (More on Aisuru and related)
- Organic HTTP application-layer attack capability; HTTPS attacks reflected through onboard residential proxy service. (More on Aisuru and related)
- Attack traffic generated by TurboMirai DDoS botnets such as Aisuru is not spoofed because the botnet code does not run in a privileged context on compromised devices; additionally, most botnet nodes are sited on broadband access networks that have source-address validation (SAV) mechanisms enabled by default at the access layer (More on Aisuru and related)
